# Data Visualization
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a> is a nonprofit organization helping thousands of people learn to code for free. This respository captures my personal solutions to the data analysis with python projects.

# Projects
These projects are made for the freeCodeCamp Data Visualization Certification. The objective was to use JSON and APIs while also using different types of data with the D3.js library in order to build five data projects that fulfill freeCodeCamp's requirements based on charts, graphs, and maps. To find further information on the projects, they are provided below.
